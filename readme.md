I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer! Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## About me

I'm Ire, a Front-End Developer and User Interface Designer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I write weekly technical articles on my blogs, [bitsofcode](https://bitsofco.de) & [Hello Angular](https://helloangular.com). I give talks about User Experience Design, Front-End development, or anything I find interesting. I design and build web applications. I currently work as Head of Technology at [Big Cabal](http://bigcabal.com). I build products & tools that are used by hundreds of developers, and [share the code](https://github.com/ireade).
